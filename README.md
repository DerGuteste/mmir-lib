mmir-lib
========

https://github.com/mmig/mmir-lib


Source Code for the [mmir][5] (Mobile Multimodal Interaction and Rendering) library

The `mmir` framework provides means for creating _minimal_ (client-based)
_dialog systems_ for multimodal interactions:

 * state-based interaction handling using SCXML (e.g. for touch/click, speech, gesture interactions)
 * support and plugins for several speech input (Automatic Speech Recognition, ASR) engines
 * support and plugins for several speech output/synthesis (Text To Speech, TTS) engines
 * support for client- or sever-based NLU processing
  * built-in support for grammars (similar to BNF grammars that parse input as _tokens_ and _utterances_)

See API documentation is available at [/docs][6] (`md` format) or in [HTML format][7]
(more details are available in [jsdoc-generated API documentation][8], and further details at [github.com/mmig/mmir][5]).

For examples, see the [mmir-starter-kit][1] or [mmir-starter-ionic][2].

# Usage

## Building Grammars, State Machines etc.

 * Prerequesites: Node.js

Some resources (e.g. grammars, state machines) can be built/compiled before they
are used in the application at runtime.  
Note that most of these resources can be compiled during runtime too (as in case
of grammars and state machines).

Pre-building these resources is supported e.g. via the [mmir-tooling][3] project.

In addition, the [mmir-wepack][4] integration provides special support
for including `mmir` in webpack-based/-built applications.

## Include in Web Page

The following shows an example of including `mmir-lib` in a web page "as-is", i.e. without
any build-system (like `webpack`).

`mmir-lib` includes `requirejs` for (async) lazy-loading its sub-modules.

 * include `/lib` as directory `/mmirf` in your web resources directory, e.g. `/www/mmirf`  
   _(e.g. use [`mmirinstall`][12] script of `mmir-tooling`: `mmirinstall www/mmirf`)_

 * load/include `mmir` in HTML page
   ```html
   <!-- OPTIONAL helper script: auto-detect Cordova-environment and load its library if necessary: -->
   <script type="text/javascript" src="mmirf/tools/initCordova.js"></script>

   <!-- load the framework's core/base object -->
   <script type="text/javascript" src="mmirf/core.js"></script>

   <!-- OPTIONAL: configure mmir framework before it starts loading/initializing
                   using some custom script (in this example at appjs/preinit.js)
                   for more details see the documentation at github.com/mmig/mmir
   -->
   <script type="text/javascript" src="appjs/preinit.js"></script>

   <!-- load mmir library -->
   <script type="text/javascript" src="mmirf/vendor/libs/require.min.js" data-main="mmirf/mainConfig" ></script>
   ```
 * use `mmir` in JavaScript code (after it's been initialized)
   ```javascript
   mmir.ready(function(){
     ...
   })
   ```

## Node.js

```javascript
var mmirLib = require('mmir-lib');

//optional: run some configuration before starting to initialize mmir
var preInitFunc = function(mmir){
  //... some custom configuration for mmir before loading the library
};

//init should only be called once:
var mmir = mmirLib.init(preInitFunc);

mmir.ready(function(){
  ...
});
```

### Node.js and WebWorker

For some functionality (e.g. async-compiling grammars, state-manager event processing), `mmir` uses `WebWorker`s.
While most of the these functionalities do have fallback implementations, they
may not always provide the same functionality, and run less efficiently.

`mmir` can use the following `WebWorker` implementations as drop-ins for
HTML5 `WebWorker`s when running in `node`:

 * built-in `node` module `worker_threads` (recommended):
   * since version 10.5.0 available as _experimental_ feature:  
     use/enable by running `node` with command-line argument `--experimental-worker`, e.g.
     ```bash
     # when using node directly
     node --experimental-worker ...
     # when using npm
     npm --node-options --experimental-worker ...
     # set as node env variable (*nix)
     export NODE_OPTIONS=$NODE_OPTIONS --experimental-worker
     # set as node env variable (Windows)
     set NODE_OPTIONS=%NODE_OPTIONS% --experimental-worker
     # add entry in npm configuration file .npmrc:
     #node-options = --experimental-worker
     ```
   * since `node` version 11.x `worker_threads` is enabled by default

 * alternative module `webworker-threads` with version >= 0.8.x
   * NOTE not everything may work using this package (if possible use `worker_threads`)
   * [worker_threads at npm][10]: current version is 0.7.x
   * [worker_threads on github][11]: current version is 0.8.x

## Additional Notes

More details, further documentation etc. are available on the [mmir][5] project page.

See also the [tools project][3] for scripts, resources etc. for compiling and
generating resources (e.g. for compiling JSON grammar files from the application's
`config/languages/[language code]/` directories into JavaScript files).

NOTE: Integration with / loading of Cordova is designed to work with the
      _build process_ of **Cordova 5 or later** (see [mmir-tooling][3] and
      [cordova example project][9] for integration / tooling of the `mmir`
      framework in combination with Cordova 5 and later versions).
